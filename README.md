## Major Lox-luxya differences
chuj!


## Usage
To run any script source run:
```sh
$ luxya <source>
```

To run in REPL mode (which is not yet finished):
```sh
$ luxya
```


## Compilation and development
The source comprises two parts:
- the `src/ast/*` generated by `tools/generate_ast.py`
- the rest

To get a release build just use `make`:
```sh
$ make
```

There are also a couple of useful dev commands like:
```sh
# run REPL in watch mode
$ make watch

# run the `sample_program.lux` in watch mode
# (script source overridable with sample_program_path in makefile)
$ make watch_sample

# run the `generate_ast.py` script with mypy checks in watch mode
# (script source overridable with generate_ast_path in makefile)
$ make watch_generate_ast
```
